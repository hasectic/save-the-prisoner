# save-the-prisoner
a rule in which we have to find a prisoner who is going to die, jail has  prisoners, and each prisoner has a unique id number, , ranging from  to . There are  sweets that must be distributed to the prisoners.  The jailer decides the fairest way to do this is by sitting the prisoners down in a circle (ordered by ascending ), and then, starting with some random , distribute one candy at a time to each sequentially numbered prisoner until all  candies are distributed. For example, if the jailer picks prisoner , then his distribution order would be  until all  sweets are distributed.  But wait—there's a catch—the very last sweet is poisoned! Can you find and print the ID number of the last prisoner to receive a sweet so he can be warned?
